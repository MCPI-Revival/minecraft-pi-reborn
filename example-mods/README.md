# Example Mods
This is an example of a mod that can be built using the modding SDK.

* **Expanded Creative Mod**: This specific mod adds even more items and blocks to the Creative Inventory. It was originally by [@Bigjango13](https://github.com/bigjango13).
* **Chat Commands Mod**: This specific mod makes an chat message starting with a ``/`` handled by the MCPI API.
* **Recipes Mod**: This specific mod demos custom recipes.

## The SDK
The modding SDK is a collection of exported CMake targets that allows anyone to create their own MCPI mod!

The SDK is copied to ``~/.minecraft-pi/sdk/lib/minecraft-pi-reborn-client/sdk/sdk.cmake`` whenever MCPI-Reborn is started.

## How do I use this?
```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cp libexpanded-creative.so ~/.minecraft-pi/mods
```
