# ``misc`` Mod
This mod has several miscellaneous mods that are too small to be their own mod, including:
* Rendering text above the hotbar when an item is selected.
* Sanitizing player usernames for invalid characters.
* Removing the red background from unobtainable items in the inventory.
* Loading the bundled language file.
* Printing chat messages to the log.
