# Overriding Assets
To make overriding assets easier, MCPI-Reborn provides an overrides folder. Any file located in Minecraft: Pi Edition's `data` folder can be overridden by placing a file with the same name and path in the overrides folder. The overrides folder is located at `~/.minecraft-pi/overrides`.

## Examples
- `data/images/terrain.png` -> `~/.minecraft-pi/overrides/images/terrain.png`
- `data/lang/en_US.lang` -> `~/.minecraft-pi/overrides/lang/en_US.lang`
