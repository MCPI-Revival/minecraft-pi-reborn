# Custom Skins
MCPI-Reborn supports downloading custom skins from [a central skin server](https://github.com/MCPI-Revival/Skins). Skins are downloaded based on the current MCPI username.

This *does not* cache skins and *will not* work without internet access.

Custom skins can be disabled using the `Load Custom Skins` feature flag.
