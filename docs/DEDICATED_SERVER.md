# Dedicated Server
The dedicated server is a version of Minecraft: Pi Edition modified to run in a headless environment.
It loads settings from a `server.properties` file.

This server is also compatible with MCPE Alpha v0.6.1[^1].

## Setup
To use, run the normal AppImage with the `--server` argument. It will generate the world and `server.properties` in the current directory.

[^1]: The exception to this is buckets and other modded items, those will crash MCPE players.
