# Dedicated Server
The dedicated server is a version of Minecraft: Pi Edition modified to run in a headless environment.
It loads settings from a `server.properties` file.

Compatibility with vanilla MCPE/MCPI can be enabled;
however, this will break compatibility with many configurations of MCPI-Reborn.

## Setup
To use, run the normal AppImage with the `--server` argument. It will generate the world and `server.properties` in the current directory.
