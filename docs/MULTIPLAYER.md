# Multiplayer
MCPI-Reborn supports two ways to play multiplayer.

## Local Network (LAN)
This is also supported by vanilla MCPI. Just load a world in MCPI and other devices on the network can join.

## External Servers
Unlike vanilla MCPI, MCPI-Reborn allows you to natively join a server outside of the local network. Just modify `~/.minecraft-pi/servers.txt` and it should show up in MCPI's server list.

### Example `~/.minecraft-pi/servers.txt`
```
# Default Port Is 19132
example.com
# Custom Port
example.com:19133
```
